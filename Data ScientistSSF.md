# Data Scientist

Data Scientist/Artificial Intelligence Scientist plans and leads
the development of new and advanced data analytic techniques,
methodologies and analytical solutions from design, prototyping
and testing. He/She identifies and develops core data and artificial
intelligence (AI) science components for the delivery of projects,
architects specialised database and computing environments,
explores and visualises complex data sets to provide incremental
business value. He extracts and integrates data from various
sources, and creates advanced models and algorithms suitable for
the business use case. He conducts testing on data and AI models,
interprets findings from testing, and evaluates model performance
for scaling and deployment. He develops compelling and logically
structured communication materials to facilitate stakeholder
buy-in.

He works in a team setting and is proficient in statistics, scripting
and programming languages required by the organisation. He is also
familiar with the relevant software platforms on which the solution
is deployed on.

The Data Scientist/AI Scientist has strong analytical and critical
thinking skills to identify and solve problems. He is passionate about
analysing and resolving complex business problems, displaying
intellectual curiosity towards using data and AI to address business
needs and challenges. He is a data storyteller, and is able to
influence key stakeholders and spearhead a data driven approach
to resolve business issues.

# Critical Work Functions Key Tasks 


## Manage data preparation and modelling
	• Define objectives and hypothesis for research on data and AI models
	• Analyse the ways in which datasets may be biased and address this in safety measures and deployment strategies
	• Conduct extraction and integration of data including features from different data sources
	• Develop multiple models and algorithms suitable for the use case
	• Perform model comparison to draw inferences on variable importance
	• Select the best model based on pre-defined evaluation criteria
	• Account for data ethics and policies in model selection and evaluation process
	• Interpret and evaluate model performance for scaling and deployment


## Build and assess models
• Conduct testing on final model in real-time business conditions prior to deployment
• Scale and deploy models in real-time business conditions for end user consumption
• Initiate autonomous monitoring to scale human oversight
• Document modelling techniques used and assumptions made against test outcomes
• Enable end user capability to use AI/ Data Science products effectively



## Present data driven business value of data science/AI models
• Create reports and deliverables based on insights derived from the model results
• Develop compelling, logically structured presentations including story-telling of research and/or analytics findings to secure stakeholder commitment
• Contribute to the creation of leading-edge resources, including playbooks, guides, blog posts, videos, etc.
